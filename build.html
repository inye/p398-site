<p>
We've started to work on various designs of our future object right after we've reflected on received data.  We've picked out several candidates and tried to figure out whether it's possible to create them on our own. In the end we've picked out a flower on a base as a final candidate.
</p>
<p>
The flower should have two basic states (an open and a closed one) that reflect current state of the portal — a neutral or with resonator(s) deployed. This idea was a huge success. Moreover, we approve unanimously on choosing highlight color depending on the faction — the flower should be highlighted white if it's neutral; blue if the Resistance captures it; and green if the Enlightened captures the portal.
</p>
<p>
The key feature is the ability of the object to hear and to respond. The flower has a microphone that detects sounds that are further transmitted to the portal network through a Techtulhu module. The response, in turn, is projected onto a so-called glyph pad in the center on the flower.

<h2>Project description</h2>


<p>
Principal parts are: 
</p><ol>

<li>The base: a pedestal made of two octagons stack on top of each other. The bottom one has a diameter of 2.4 meters; the upper one — of 1.48 meters. The first one is 0.3 meters high; the second one is 0.18 meters high. 
<li>The petals are attached to the upper part. Each petal is approx. 2 meters long. Closed bud diameter is 1.5 meters long. Maximum diameter in the open state will take up to 5 meters. The petals are highlighted with LEDs from the inside. 
<li>A glyph pad is sitting in the center of the whole construction. It consists of 6 screens that project glyphs. Glyph pad diameter is about 0.4 meters.
<li>Glyph pad has a pole. Inside the pole are a petals opener and some commutation.
<li>Bud's center and glyph pad pole are decorated with additional petals and LEDs.</li></ol>

<h2>Base</h2>


<p>
Base is a loaded, hollow-core two-stage construction made of plywood. Inner frame is made of joists and planks interconnected with metal angles.
</p>
<p>
Equipment units are placed inside the base.
</p>
<p>
There are several fabrication holes for power supply and beltings.
</p>
<p>
Construction nodes and equipment units are consists of batteries, power box, and motor. Gravity center of the whole construction is in the lower part of the device. This prevents tipping over in case of heavy wind. 
</p>
<p>
Quick access to the equipment is provided through several trap doors on the surface of the lower part of the base. Upper part has additional inner frame.

<h2>Petals</h2>


<p>
Petals are attached to the surface of the base. Petals are made of polyethylene foam ('Isolon'). It is a light material that easily diffuses light and can sustain its form.
</p>
<p>
Metal-reinforced plastic pipes stiffen petals and are their frame. LED strips are attaches to these pipes to highlight the foam. Petals are attached to the base with hot-melt glue. Apart from LEDs, there will be microphones on petal edges. Microphone cables are placed inside the pipes.
</p>
<p>
The petals fold up to form a bud. The bud is about 2 meters high. The maximum diameter of the bud is around 1.5 meters. The maximum diameter of the flower when it's open is about 5 meters. 
</p>
<p>
Commutations for LEDs and microphones are places inside the base. Inner surface on the bud is filled with little petals. They provide additional body and cover bud opener and glyph pad pole. Those petals are also highlighted with LEDs placed on the bottom of the flower.

<h2>Glyph pad</h2>


<p>
Glyph pad consists of 6 hexagonal panels with fixed sequence on LEDs placed on them.
</p>
<p>
These hexagons form a sphere. Glyph pad's 'brain' and a cross-bud can be found inside the sphere. A signal from master node is transmitted via commutation cable placed along the pole.
</p>
<p>
Sphere's diameter is about 0.4 meters. 
</p>
<p>
Glyph pad projects the same glyph on every panel simultaneously. This ensures the glyph pad can be seen from all angles.

A metal pole covers up all communication lines of the glyph pad. The bud opener is also placed inside the pole.
</p>
<h2>Glyph pad pole</h2>


<p>
The bud opener is also placed inside the glyph pad pole. The opener is a screw-jack mechanism that is driven by the motor hidden inside the base. External petals are attached to the external nodes on the mechanism with steel strings. Petals are opening and closing by this mechanism.
</p>
<p>
The pole is a pipe of 0.15 meters in diameter and about 1 meter high. Eight holes are cut in the pipe; external nodes of the screw-jack re put through these holes. The screw-jack is securely fixed on z-axis. When the petals are closed, the nodes are retracted in the pole; petals are pulled up.  When the petals are closed, external nodes are under the smaller petals on the bottom.

We've defined all parts of out portal object. Some engineer skills were applied when putting together this construction. LED highlighting and the glyph pad weren't possible without some coding and cabling skills.
</p>
<p>
The construction itself is not that complicated but it's visually rich and extravagant. We believe it will turn some heads ☺
