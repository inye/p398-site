          <p>
          We came across some <a href="/story.html">long-forgotten Soviet pilot projects and researches on XM
            communications</a> that were conducted way before Lynton-Wolfe’s groundbreaking attempts. We
          know how to build a <a href="/build.html">Listener Portal</a> based on these works, a portal that can transmit
          researchers’ voices into out-of-reach depth of portal network and possibly receive an
          answer. The only thing we lack of is a ‘Funnel’, or, as it called within NIA, a Techtulhu
          module. This device will help us establish contact with N’Zeers, Shapers or — who know? —
          even some other exogenous entities.

          <p>
          We are a <a href="/team.html">group of Res agents</a> born in the USSR. We've visited many places, we've done a
          lot of different things, we've seen a lot, but we never created a real portal before.
          Nonetheless, we strongly believe we are bound to be successful, and our flower will bloom
          in Schloß Kaltenberg.
